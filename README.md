# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT<BR>
## PROJECT:SIMPLE CALCULATOR

The *Calculator* is a simple Java-based command-line application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers, and the program will compute and display the following results:

- *Sum*: Adds the two numbers.
- *Difference*: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- *Product*: Multiplies the two numbers.
- *Quotient*: Divides the first number by the second.

This project serves as an introductory example of using Java for simple mathematical computations and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like input handling, arithmetic operations, and console output.

## Features
- Accepts user input for two numbers.
- Computes and displays:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Java
- *Development Environment*: Any Java IDE or terminal with JDK installed

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone the repository or download the Calculator.java file.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) or terminal.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
4. Run the program using:
   ```
   java Calculator
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to input two numbers, and view the results.

## Example Output
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Number 1: 10.0
Number 2: 5.0
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```
